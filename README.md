# ix-lisbon-project-week-1

Here is the repo with the project brief and where you should push your final poker game .py file. Might be a good idea to edit this README to include a link to your blog (where in a post you should link this repo too) :) 

The deadline is **tomorrow (Friday) the 31st of May at 8pm**.

Blog is live but it is missing an explanation of the inner workings of the poker_game.py file.

Poker game executes but gets stuck as follows:

```
Please enter number of players:
2
Please enter player name:F
Please enter player name:Q
[[2, 6, 'J', 8, 3], ['Q', 'Q', 'K', 'J', 'A']]
Please enter number of players:
2
```
